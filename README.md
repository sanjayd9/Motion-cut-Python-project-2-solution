# Project: Word Counter (Build a program that
counts the number of words in a given text)
# Project Overview
As part of your Python Programming Internship, your Week 2 project will be centered around
creating a "Word Counter" program. Below is an overview of the project, its objectives, and the
necessary requirements and features.
The Word Counter project is designed to strengthen your understanding and application of Python
programming concepts. The task involves creating a simple program that counts the number of
words in a given sentence or paragraph.
# Project Objectives
To accurately outline the scope of work required for a project, it is crucial to first identify its
objectives. Pinpointing what the project hopes to accomplish will assist in determining its
inclusions and limitations.
Understanding Input Handling: Learn how to take user input in Python.
String Manipulation: Explore string manipulation techniques for text processing.
Function Creation: Practice creating functions in Python for modular code.
Basic Control Flow: Implement basic control flow structures to control the program's logic.
Output Display: Display the word count as the output of the program.
# Requirements and Features
• User Input: Prompt the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.
• Word Counting Logic: Implement a function that counts the number of words in the input.  Output Display: Print the word count to the console.
Error Handling: Account for potential errors, such as empty input.
Code Comments: Add comments to explain the purpose of different parts of your code.
User-Friendly Interface: Ensure a clear and user-friendly interface for input and output

# word_count function: This function takes a sentence as input, splits it into words using whitespace as a delimiter, and returns the count of words.

# main function: This function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph, checks for empty input, calls the word_count function, and displays the word count.

# User Input: The input function is used to take user input.

# Word Counting Logic: The word counting logic is encapsulated in the word_count function.

# Error Handling: Checks for empty input and displays an error message if needed.

# Code Comments: Comments are added to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.

# User-Friendly Interface: The program prompts the user for input and provides clear output.
